# Who
This program was implemented by Tony Nguyen and Michael Morgan. Dr. Fagg, Computer Science professor at the University of Oklahoma, provided the data as it was his project.

# About
This project is a Java GUI program that takes data from the Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler (SIPPC), more details about this below, and models it.

The Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler (SIPPC) is an assistive robot that aids infants at risk for Cerebral Palsy as they learn how to crawl. The robotic platform supports an infant’s weight and amplifies her crawling-like movements by carrying her across the floor in the indicated direction. This interaction serves to encourage the infant to continue practicing crawling movements and allows the infant to actively explore her immediate environment.

One sensor subsystem worn by the infant is a kinematic capture suit. Small inertial measurement units (IMUs) are strapped to the infant at twelve different points. 1 These sensors, among other information, provide an estimate of the orientation of key body segments. Combined with a skeletal model of the infant, we are able to infer in real time the position of particular points on the infant, including the wrists and feet. This position is recorded in the units of meters and is relative to the small of the infant’s back. Furthermore, the coordinate frame is as follows: +X runs from the small of the infant’s back to the head, +Y points to the right of the infant, and +Z emanates from the back of the infant (hence, we have a right-handed coordinate frame).
